        "1. What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n",
        "- In Python, a function is a standalone block of code that is defined independently, while a method is a function that is associated with an object or a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example\n",
        "  Function example: `len()` is a built-in Python function.\n",
        "  my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "  print(f\"Using a function: The length of my_list is {len(my_list)}\")\n",
        "\n",
        "  Method example: `append()` is a method of the list object.\n",
        "  my_list.append(4)\n",
        "  print(f\"Using a method: The updated list is {my_list}\")\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
        "  - A parameter is a variable defined in a function's header during its definition, acting as a placeholder. An argument is the actual value passed to the function when it is called.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Example\n",
        "  \n",
        "    'name' and 'greeting' are the parameters\n",
        "    \n",
        "    def greet(name, greeting=\"Hello\"):\n",
        "      print(f\"{greeting}, {name}!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "    \"Alice\" and \"Good morning\" are the arguments\n",
        "   greet(\"Alice\", \"Good morning\")\n",
        "\n",
        "   Calling with one positional and one default argument\n",
        "   greet(\"Bob\")\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the purpose of the return statement in a Python function?\n",
        "  The return statement is used to exit a function and send a value back to the caller. Any code after it is not executed. If omitted, the function returns None.\n",
        "  Example\n",
        "\n",
        "  def get_sum(a, b):\n",
        "    return a + b\n",
        "    print(\"This line will not be executed.\")\n",

        "5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "  An iterable is an object you can loop over (e.g., lists, strings, tuples). It has an __iter__() method that returns an iterator. An iterator is an object representing a stream of data that keeps track of its position during iteration. It has a __next__() method to get the next item and raises StopIteration when finished.\n",
        "  Example\n",
        "\n",
        "  my_list = [1, 2, 3]     An iterable\n",
        "  my_iterator = iter(my_list)    Get an iterator\n",

        "  print(next(my_iterator))\n",
        "  print(next(my_iterator))\n",
        "  print(next(my_iterator))\n",
        "\n",
        "   A `for` loop implicitly creates an iterator\n",
        "  print(\"\\nUsing a for loop:\")\n",
        "  for item in my_list:\n",
        "    print(item)\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "  Generators are a special type of iterator that generate values on demand (lazily). They are defined using a generator function, which contains the yield keyword instead of return, or using a generator expression.\n",
        "  Example\n",
        "\n",
        "   Generator function using `yield`\n",
        "    def even_numbers(n):\n",
        "      for i in range(n):\n",
        "        if i % 2 == 0:\n",
        "            yield i\n",
        "\n",
        "    Generator expression\n",
        "  even_gen = (i for i in range(10) if i % 2 == 0)\n",
        "  Iterate through the generator function\n",
        "  print(\"Even numbers from generator function:\")\n",
        "  for num in even_numbers(10):\n",
        "      print(num, end=\" \")\n",
        "\n",
        "  print(\"\\n\\nEven numbers from generator expression:\")\n",
        " Iterate through the generator expression\n",
        "  for num in even_gen:\n",
        "      print(num, end=\" \")\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "  - Generators are memory-efficient, especially for large datasets, because they generate values one by one instead of creating the entire sequence in memory. They can also represent infinite sequences and are useful in data processing pipelines.\n",
        "Example\n",
        "\n",
        "A generator is more memory-efficient for large sequences\n",
        "def large_list_func(n):\n",
        "    return [i for i in range(n)]\n",
        "\n",
        "def large_generator_func(n):\n",
        "    for i in range(n):\n",
        "        yield i\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "  -A lambda function is a small, anonymous function defined with the lambda keyword. It can only contain a single expression and is often used for short, simple operations or as an argument to higher-order functions like map(), filter(), and sorted().\n",
        "Example\n",
        "\n",
        "   Define a lambda function to add two numbers\n",
        "add = lambda x, y: x + y\n",
        "print(f\"Lambda result: {add(5, 3)}\")\n",
        "\n",
        "   Using lambda with `sorted()` to sort a list of tuples by the second element\n",
        "pairs = [(1, 'b'), (3, 'a'), (2, 'c')]\n",
        "sorted_pairs = sorted(pairs, key=lambda x: x[1])\n",
        "print(f\"Sorted pairs: {sorted_pairs}\")\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Explain the purpose and usage of the map() function in Python.\n",
        "  -The map() function applies a given function to each item in an iterable and returns an iterator of the results. It's an efficient way to transform items in a sequence without an explicit loop.\n",
        "Example\n",
        "\n",
        "def square(x):\n",
        "    return x * x\n",
        "\n",
        "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
        "squared_numbers_map = map(square, numbers)\n",
        "\n",
        "   Convert the map object to a list for printing\n",
        "print(f\"Squared numbers (using map): {list(squared_numbers_map)}\")\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between map(), reduce(), and filter() functions in Python?\n",
        "  -\tmap() transforms each item in an iterable by applying a function, returning a new iterable of the same size.\n",
        "  -\tfilter() constructs a new iterable containing only the items from the original for which a given function returns True.\n",
        "  -reduce() cumulatively applies a function to the items of an iterable to reduce it to a single value. It requires importing from the functools module.\n",
        "Example\n",
        "\n",
        "from functools import reduce\n",
        "\n",
        "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
