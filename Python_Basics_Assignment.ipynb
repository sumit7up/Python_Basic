        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "   - Python is a programming language. Its popular because it is versatlie, easy to understand, has huge libraries and has large active community.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "    - Interpretor in python is aprogram that converts human readable code to byte code which machine can understand. It takes the python code as .py file and converts into bytecode.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "  - pre-defined keywords in Python are some words that have special meaning in python. Python itslef knows the meaning of such keywords. Some examples if, elif, def, while, else, for, break, continue.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "  - No, keywords can not be used as variable names.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "  - Mutability refers to changeability or which can be modified afterwards also. Example list in puthon is mutable\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "  - List are mutable because it allows the data stored in it to be changed.\n",
        "  - Tuples are immutable because it doesn't allow the data stored in it to be changed. It will give error when we try to change the data\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "  - \"==\" is equality operator. It compares the values of two objects. It checks if the content or data represented by the objects same or not.\n",
        "  - \"is\" is identity operator. It compares the identity of two objects. It checks if two variables refer to the exact same object in memory or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "  - There are three primary logical operators: and, or, and not.\n",
        "  These operators are helpful in decision making.\n",
        "  \"and\" - it returns true if both operands are true.\n",
        "  \"or\" - it returns true if either one operand is true.\n",
        "  \"not\" - it returns true if operand is false and viceversa.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "  - Type casting in Python, also known as type conversion, is the process of converting a value from one data type to another.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "  - Implicit type casting (or conversion) happens automatically by the compiler or interpreter while explicit type casting requires to explicitly specify the conversion using a cast operator or function\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "  - The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to control the flow of execution in a program based on whether certain conditions are true or false. They help in decision making.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "  - elif statement is used to test multiple conditions in a sequential manner. It always follows an if statement and can be followed by an optional else statement. Code in elif block gets executed when the condition of if statement becomes false. If there are multiples elif then the condition of first elif will be checked, if its false then only the second elif;s condition will be checked.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "  - \"for\" loops are typically used when the number of iterations is known beforehand, on the other hand, \"while\" loops are used when the number of iterations is not predetermined and depends on a condition that is evaluated during runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "  - While loop can be more suitable than for loop in scenarios like when we want user input untill a certain condition is met. For example if we want to input a valid email id from user then we can use while loop. The loop will terminate only when the user inputs the email id in correct format. If the user inputs invalid email id the loop will not terminate."
